If you seldom visit your house or if you live alone and oftentimes spend more hours at work, then you can change your air filter every 6 – 12 months. However, if you have a pet, you ought to change it every 2 months. If you have more than one pet or if anyone at home has allergies, make sure to clean it every 20-45 days. </span></span>

Dust accumulation or too much build-up can cause your AC to work improperly. It would also entail an increase in your electricity bills since it will pressure the unit to work hard to compensate for the desired output. Soon your unit will experience a failure in its system, making you spend more in the process. </span></span>
